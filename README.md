# Employee Task Management System

This project was created for a **ProU assessment**.
It is a full-stack application built using:

The system allows users to:

* Register and log in
* Manage employees (add, edit, delete)
* Create tasks with:

  * Status
  * Priority

  * Completed & Pending task counts
